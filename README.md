<h1 style="font-size: 20px">HOURGLASS - <i>Minivan Retail Company Website</i> - 2022</h1>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>

The following project is a website design concept presentation, based from an auto-generated design brief, for a fictional retail company called Hourglass. They make affordable minivans with an emphasis on design and their target audience is older teens/young adults. (Prototype dimensions in Adobe XD: 1920 x 1080 px.)

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">THE CHALLENGE</h2>

The inquiry from Hourglass was for a design that conveys a sense of importance, while being agreeable. They wanted an informative website that is easy to navigate. The inquiry requested it include About, Shop, and Privacy Policy Pages, with the Landing Page containing a Contact Us section. They requested the Call to Action to be convincing users to subscribe to their newsletter. They also wanted a luxurious design that incorporates their brand color, which is yellow.

<!--The above is my completed (version 1) clickable, high-fidelity wireframe prototype personally created in Adobe XD based on the fictional client's request, design structures used in real vehicle retailers' websites, and user experience (UX) design standards and guidelines. *Prototype contains "Lorem Ipsums" taking the place of an actual body of content a real client would have written. Images were taken from resources such as Unsplash, Pexels, Shutterstock, etc.-->

<!--Once I made my v. 1 prototype, I uploaded it to a website creators use for finding real volunteers to test their interface designs to gain insights on moving forward with re-designing an improved, finalized project. I commissioned a minimum of 20 testers, male and female, between the ages of 18 to 65, to test the mission of moving from the starting point at the Landing Page, to the ending point at the Schedule Test Drive Page. Below are the quantitative test results.-->

<!--Below are the polled opinions testers selected regarding the difficulty level of the mission and the visual design/layout of the interface after the user completes the whole mission and views the other pages unrelated to the mission, such as the About Us and Locate Dealer pages. *Due to the technical limitations of the testing website, users were not able to view elements that involved animations/movement.-->

<!--I found from these results that almost all of the testers left with a positive impression. When asked on the prototype's strengths, testers mostly commented on its ease of use, intuitiveness, cleanness of design, and logical flow of information. Testers did not offer much in the way of commenting on the prototype's weaknesses, but what I've gathered from those responses, the prototype could stand to be more dynamic and modernized aesthetically.

Commonly written suggestions given by testers when asked to view the prototype page by page included:

*Incorporating more color variety
*Decreasing number of vehicle description boxes on each Shop Page
*Reducing amounts of text to de-clutter Shop, About Us, & Privacy Policy Pages
*Improving the map design on Locate Dealer Page
*Changing "Shop" to "Find a Vehicle", as that phrase better fits user flow's end destination
*Improving design of Landing Page's hero box so it's more eye-catching-->

<!--Reflecting on the input received from my testers, and returning to version 1 after several weeks since its completion with a renewed perspective, I created this finalized version.-->

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">SUMMARY OF IMPROVEMENTS​​​​​​​</h2>

<!--This project opened my eyes to the importance of "breathing room" more than anything. Upon re-navigating through the user flow of my version 1 and then doing the same with this version, I realize how much more visually pleasing the prototype is, now that sections of text have been decreased in volume, unnecessary details have been omitted, and elements are now spread further out from each other in general.

I enjoyed the process of imagining and creating a sleek looking pinpoint icon to go with the new and more logical map image, which better indicates the dealerships' locations. A major improvement idea I realized and implemented for the Schedule Test Drive Page was replacing some of the questions with an interactive calendar element to allow the user to schedule the test drive themselves. I feel these two particular changes, among others, helped establish my project as more realistic to how websites function and present information today.-->
